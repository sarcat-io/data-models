# Data parsing
Dependent upon source and format. All parsing tools ingest data outputs and formats specific to a product or service and output SARCAT standard objects. If your system leverages tooling here, be sure to contribute improvements where possible. 
If your org is the manufacturer/vendor/provider of the products/services, you are required to lead creation and validation of data parsing tools.. 


Tools must be object version specific. All object versions will have transition automation to versions that come after. Some future versions may have a data value delta required to be supplement for completness and to meet the current standard at that time.
